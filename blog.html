                            <h5>var</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">Before the advent of ES6, var declarations ruled. There are issues
                                associated with variables declared with var, though. That is why it was necessary for
                                new ways to declare variables to emerge. First, let's get to understand var more before
                                we discuss those issues.</p>
                            <h5>Scope of var</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">Scope essentially means where these variables are available for use.
                                var declarations are globally scoped or function/locally scoped.

                                The scope is global when a var variable is declared outside a function. This means that
                                any variable that is declared with var outside a function block is available for use in
                                the whole window.

                                var is function scoped when it is declared within a function. This means that it is
                                available and can be accessed only within that function. var variables can be
                                re-declared and updated</p>
                            <h5>Let</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">let is now preferred for variable declaration. It's no surprise as it
                                comes as an improvement to var declarations. It also solves the problem with var that we
                                just covered. Let's consider why this is so.</p>
                            <h5>let is block scoped</h5>
                            <p>A block is a chunk of code bounded by {}. A block lives in curly braces. Anything within
                                curly braces is a block.

                                So a variable declared in a block with let is only available for use within that block.
                            </p>
                            <h5>Const</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">Variables declared with the const maintain constant values. const
                                declarations share some similarities with let declarations.</p>
                            <h5>const declarations are block scoped</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">Like let declarations, const declarations can only be accessed within
                                the block they were declared.</p>
                        </div>

                            <h3 class="card-title">Regular vs Arrow Function</h3>
                            <h5>Arrow Function</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.</p>
                            <h5>Regular Function</h5>
                            <p class="card-text">nside of a regular JavaScript function, this value (aka the execution context) is dynamic.

                                The dynamic context means that the value of this depends on how the function is invoked. In JavaScript, there are 4 ways you can invoke a regular function.</p>
